## üîç What I Did

### üõ†Ô∏è Steps in the Analysis Process:

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset) as a CSV file.

2. **Data Cleaning & Wrangling**  
   - Checked for missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized key patterns and relationships using Python libraries.

4. **Business Questions Explored:**
   - Which room type is most booked by families with children?
   - What‚Äôs the most common group size?
   - Which months are the busiest for bookings?
   - What do repeat guests usually book?

# **Insights**

**Hotel Booking Insights Summary**

1. **Room Preferences for Families**

   * **Room Type 1** is the top choice for guests with children, making up **54.6%** of bookings.
   * **Room Type 6** follows at **29.1%**.

2. **Most Common Group Size**

   * The majority of hotel bookings are for **2 people**, with **15,573 reservations** made for this group size.

3. **Monthly Booking Trends**

   * **October** sees the highest booking volume (**3,423 bookings**), followed by **September** (**3,067**) and **December** (**2,603**).

4. **Room Preferences of Repeat Guests**

   * **Room Type 1** dominates among returning guests, accounting for **86.8%** of repeat bookings.
   * **Room Type 4** is the second most chosen at **7.3%**.

5. **Booking Status by Room Type**

   * **Room Type 1** has the highest **number of cancellations** (**9,072**) and also the highest **number of completed bookings** (**19,058**), indicating its overall popularity.

6. **Special Requests by Room Type**

   * **Room Type 1** receives the most special requests (**15,691**), while **Room Type 3** receives the least.
  
# **üß© Booking Status and Correlation Analysis**

* Using the **Spearman correlation method**, the **number of special requests** shows the highest correlation with **booking status**, with a correlation coefficient of **0.256**.

* A **positive correlation (0.256)** suggests that as the number of special requests increases, the booking status (e.g., confirmed or canceled) tends to move in the same direction.

* This value indicates a **weak to moderate positive relationship**, meaning that while special requests may have an influence on booking status, other factors likely play a more significant role.

* Using **point-biserial correlation** to measure the relationship between a numerical and a categorical variable (booking status: canceled vs. not canceled), the analysis revealed that **special requests** again had the **strongest correlation** with booking status.

* The correlation coefficient is **0.253**, indicating a **positive but weak relationship** ‚Äî bookings with more special requests are **slightly less likely to be canceled**.


# **Suggestions to Improve Hotel Performance**

1. **Leverage Room Type 1‚Äôs Popularity More Strategically**

   * Since Room Type 1 is highly preferred (by families and repeat guests) but also has the most cancellations, consider:

     * Offering **flexible cancellation policies** or **incentives to confirm bookings** (e.g., early check-in or minor upgrades).
     * **Improving the description and photos** to manage expectations and reduce cancellations.

2. **Enhance Services for Families**

   * Given the high percentage of families booking Room Type 1 and Room Type 6, offer **family-focused packages** (e.g., discounts for children's meals, family activity guides, or babysitting services).

3. **Target Repeat Guests**

   * With Room Type 1 being the top choice for repeat customers, consider offering **loyalty perks** for those booking this room type, such as exclusive rates or welcome gifts.

4. **Optimize for Peak Months**

   * Boost staffing and promotions during **October, September, and December**, which are peak booking months.
   * Consider running **early bird promotions** for these months to lock in revenue and reduce last-minute cancellations.

5. **Re-evaluate Room Type 3**

   * With the fewest special requests, Room Type 3 may be under-personalized. Evaluate if its amenities or listing can be improved to increase appeal.
